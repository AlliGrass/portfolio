    "about": [
        "Having been a program enthusiast for more than 4 years I have experience in many fields which include Frontend Development, Backend Development, Cloud Computing and Network Operations. Over the years I have developed a love for programming and have a desire to solve complex tasks. I always challenge myself with new ideas to encourage myself to grow and learn new languages when I have the spare time to do so.", 
        "I am most comfortable working with JavaScript currently, though I have extensive experience with languages such as C++ and Java. This versatility is ever expanding as new ideas come to mind whenever I sit down to work on any projects."
