# My Website Portfolio

A revamp of my current portfolio using updated techniques and technologies converting from React JavaScript to React TypeScript. Until the completion of the new and improved version the previous website will remain deployed.

## Tech Stack

### **Frontend** 
#### Languages: TypeScript, HTML, Tailwind CSS
#### Frameworks: React, Next.js
<!-- State Management? -->


### **Backend**
#### Requires Further Development
<!-- #### Languages: Python
#### Framework: Django
#### Database: PostgreSql -->

## Overview

### Purpose: Showcase My Skills
In the time between my previous portfolio and now I have expanded my skillset and feel that it no longer is a representation of my abilities as a software engineer anymore. By creating a new portfolio that will be more efficient and expansive in the techniques I've learnt I hope to properly display my capabilities.

### Current Status: Early Development (Frontend)
I am building the front end of my portfolio as it is the aspect of software engineering that I have the most experience in and will be able to accomplish it in a much timely manner than if I were to simultaneously incorporate the backend to my portfolio.

### Future Plans
After the completion of the frontend I will include a backend and admin page so that as my experience and expertise grows I can efficiently update my portfolio accordingly without the requirement of needing to recommit as I currently have to do with my deployed portfolio

## Development Notes

### Incoming Development 
- Responsive Design: Fully optimized for varying screen sizes.
- Project Showcase: A section to display my projects with descriptions and technologies used.
- Dark/Light Mode: Toggleable theme for better user experience.


### Long Term Goals
- Develop a backend for efficient updating of information.
- Dynamic Resume: Updates as my experiences and skills expand for personal ease.
- Live demo of my projects to showcase directly on my page.

### Current Limitations
- This is my first time using Vercel/Next.js. There may be some aspects to this project that I have yet to encounter that will hinder my ability to work effectively purely based on my lack of experience with this technology.
- Similarly, I have never used Tailwind CSS before and may struggle to accomplish exactly what I want of it. By the same token I am not experienced in UI/UX design and will do my best to ensure my portfolio looks as good as I can make it.
